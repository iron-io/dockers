# Iron.io Docker Images

The purpose of these images is to provide the smallest possible images for
every major programming language.

Use the `iron/LANGUAGE:dev` images for building/vendoring.

Use the `iron/LANGUAGE` images for running (much smaller than the dev ones).

Examples for how to use all of these images for each language can be found here: https://github.com/iron-io/dockerworker
